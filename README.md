# Codeforces-test-cases

Made this to avoid copy pasting the test cases and validating them one by one when we have python at our disposal.

Assumptions :
1. It will make an Input folder , so make sure you are not using such a folder
2. It will make Ouput folder , so make sure you are not using such a folder
3. It will make file output_expected.txt so make sure you don't use the file which is named same
4. If multiple output can be there for an output it obviously won't work.
Changes you need to make : 
1. In line 61 you need to write whatever command you use to execute your code. eg for my case it's : g++ a.cpp -o a
    so you write the command accordingly in the code.
2.
